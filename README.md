Memory Allocation Simulator



A web-based simulator, built with React and Tailwind CSS, that visually demonstrates and compares three core memory allocation algorithms: First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit.



This project was created as part of a university course to understand the fundamental concepts of operating systems and memory management.



**✨ Features**



Three Strategies: Implements and compares First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit side-by-side.



Dynamic Configuration: Allows you to add and remove initial memory blocks (partitions) of any size.



Process Queue: Create a queue of processes with custom sizes to be allocated.



Visual Demonstration: Visually represents memory as colored blocks (blue for allocated, green for free), making it easy to see fragmentation.



Interactive Deallocation: Click "Free" to deallocate any process and watch the memory blocks automatically coalesce (merge).



Fully Responsive: Designed to work on both desktop and mobile browsers.



**🚀 How to Run**



There are two easy ways to run this:



1\. Run it Live (GitHub Pages)



You can run the live version of this simulator right in your browser at:[https://github.com/modShik/Memory-Allocation-Simulator](https://modshik.github.io/Memory-Allocation-Simulator/simulator.html)



2\. Run Locally



Download the simulator.html file from this repository.



Double-click the file.



It will open in your default web browser, and the app will be fully functional.
